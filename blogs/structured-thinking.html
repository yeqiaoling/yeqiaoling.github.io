    <h2>How to Talk to Executives When There’s No Clear Answer</h2>
    <p class="meta">By Qiaoling Ye | April 17, 2024</p>
    <p class="description">A 5-step framework for structuring ambiguous conversations, inspired by real VP-level discussions.</p>

    <h3>Intro: From executive questions to structured thinking</h3>
    <p>Recently, I had the chance to speak with several senior leaders — a VP of Data Science, a CIO, a Director of Analytics. Each conversation taught me something different.</p>
    <p>But there was one common thread: their questions weren’t about model accuracy, dashboards, or specific tools.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“How would you structure a forecasting system for seller behavior?”</li>
      <li>“How would you identify healthy eaters for a new feature rollout?”</li>
      <li>“How do you know your data product is actually influencing decisions?”</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      Can you structure ambiguity into action?<br>
      Can you create a decision path when the problem isn’t well defined?<br>
      Can you help others make better decisions — not just build better models?
    </blockquote>

    <h3>What executives are really asking for</h3>
    <p>When leaders ask “what would you do,” they don’t want a fixed solution. They’re looking for your ability to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Frame the real business goal</li>
      <li>Identify the key factors involved</li>
      <li>Lay out the options clearly</li>
      <li>Show you understand the tradeoffs</li>
      <li>Offer a principled starting point, not perfection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In other words, they want <strong>decision collaborators</strong>, not just data producers.</p>

    <h3>A mental structure — The 5-Step Response Framework</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Clarify the goal</strong><br><em>“What are we actually trying to optimize or decide?”</em></li>
      <li><strong>Define the key variables or dimensions</strong><br><em>“What are the controllable and observable factors?”</em></li>
      <li><strong>Propose 2–3 possible paths</strong><br><em>“What are some ways we could approach this, even roughly?”</em></li>
      <li><strong>Compare tradeoffs</strong><br><em>“What would each path get us, and what would we lose?”</em></li>
      <li><strong>Recommend a starting point + learning loop</strong><br><em>“Here’s what I’d try first, and how we’d learn from it.”</em></li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Example – Predicting quote acceptance in resale</h3>
    <p>In one conversation, a VP of DS asked me how I’d structure a prediction system for quote acceptance on a luxury resale platform — where every item is unique, sellers are diverse, and seasonality matters.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Goal:</strong><br> Predict whether a seller will accept a quote — to reduce latency, improve inventory flow, and inform pricing strategy.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Key variables:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Historical acceptance rate (by seller)</li>
      <li>Item characteristics (brand, category, price range)</li>
      <li>Time of year (seasonality)</li>
      <li>Time lag between quote & response</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>3. Possible paths:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seller-level behavioral modeling</li>
      <li>Item-level + brand sensitivity</li>
      <li>Contextual modeling (quote timing, macro trends)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>4. Tradeoffs:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Seller models are stable but not generalizable</li>
      <li>Item models are broader but noisier</li>
      <li>Contextual models are dynamic but harder to validate</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>5. Recommendation:</strong><br> Start with a hybrid model combining seller + item factors, and layer in contextual features for calibration. Validate via A/B test on acceptance rate uplift. Prioritize interpretability for merchandising decisions.</p>

    <h3>Why this matters</h3>
    <p>Building models is only part of our job. Communicating structured judgment is just as important — especially when working across product, operations, or with executive teams.</p>
    <p>A well-framed decision path turns ambiguity into alignment.</p>
    <p>I’m still practicing this myself. But when I do it right, I notice the conversation shifts — from “can you analyze this” to “can you help us decide.”</p>

    <h3>Let’s connect</h3>
    <p>If you're navigating ambiguous decisions in data science or product roles, I’d love to hear how you approach them. What frameworks help you bring structure into chaos?</p>
